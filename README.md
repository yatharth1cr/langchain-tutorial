# 🧠LangChain-Tutorial (JavaScript)

Hi! I'm **Yatharth**, and this is my personal LangChain learning repo.  
I'm exploring how to use **LangChain with JavaScript** to build AI-powered applications using large language models (LLMs) like **OpenAI**, **Groq**, and others.

---

## 💡What is LangChain?

**LangChain** is a framework that helps developers build apps powered by LLMs.  
It connects language models with external tools like APIs, databases, files, and more.

With LangChain, you can create things like:

- Chatbots 💬
- AI agents that call APIs 🔗
- Document Q&A tools 📄
- Search + reasoning apps 🔍🧠 

---

## 🛠️What I'm Doing Here

I'm using **Node.js** and **JavaScript** with LangChain to:

- Set up my first chatbot using the `ChatOpenAI/ChatGroq` class.
- Learn how to connect to Groq and OpenAI APIs.
- Test LLM responses using `.invoke()` calls.
- Handle `.env` files securely for API keys.
- Understand error handling for quota limits and model issues.

---

## 📂Files in This Project

- `llm.js` – Test file to send prompts to an LLM.
- `prompt-template.js`: Contains logic for creating and managing prompt templates, which are used to structure input for language models.
- `output-parsers.js`: Provides utilities for parsing and processing the output generated by LLM.
- `.env` – Stores API keys (not uploaded).
- `package.json` – Dependencies.
- `README.md` – You're reading it 😊

## ✅Example Output

```bash
> node llm.js
llm.js loaded 2025-06-01T11:27:39.413Z
Response from LLM: ************************
```

## 🌐Models I'm Trying

```
OpenAI: gpt-3.5-turbo (but needs paid quota🥹)
Groq: Fast models like llama3-8b (free & good alternative)
```

## 🚧Still Learning...

I'm figuring out:

- How to chain prompts together.
- How to use memory and tools with agents.
- How to switch models easily (OpenAI, Groq, Cohere, etc).
